# multinomial-logistic-regression

Classification is one of the most common problems in machine learning and as such many different models for doing this task have been developed. Multinomial Logistic Regression is a multiclass extension of simple Logistic Regression, which is a binary classifier. It takes as input a vector of features and as an output it gives the probabilities of each observation belonging to a class. The purpose of this report is to go over a simple implementation of this model to gain deeper insight into some of the concepts it entails.

##  Data

The dataset we'll be using to explain logistic regression is the famous Iris dataset which contains 150 observations each belonging to one of 3 classes. We separate into train and test using 120 observations for train and 30 for test. The distribution of the classes is the following:

the distribution is uniform, all classes have 50 observations.
